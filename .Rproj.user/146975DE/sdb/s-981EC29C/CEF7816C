The assignment is not for marks, and you can work in groups. The purpose of the assignment is for you to try your hand at _git_ and _RMarkdown_ with your course instructor present to assist you if you have queries or get stuck. \n\n_Hint: turn on 'see hidden files' on your system before starting the assignment._\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. Create an empty folder (e.g., assignment-1) on your flashdrive/computer.\n\n2. From the command line _(Windows: git bash, OSX/Linux: terminal)_, initialise the repository as a _git_ repository. Go check the contents of the folder in Explorer (Windows) or Finder (OSX). \n    \n    _Tip: Windows users can right-click on the folder and select 'Git Bash Here' from the context menu to open a git bash terminal with the path set to the folder._ \n\n3. Copy this file ('assignment-1.md') into the folder, and (from the command line) have _git_ start tracking the file, and commit the file for the first time.\n\n4. Open _RStudio_ and create a new project in the folder you created in step 1. Go check the contents of the folder in Explorer (Windows) or Finder (OSX).\n\n    _Tip: Windows users may need to set the path to git as follows -- RStudio > Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN > git path: <user/program files/git/bin/git.exe>. For OSX and Linux users, RStudio should automatically be integrated with git if RStudio was installed after git (if not, follow the instructions for Windows, but set the path as: <usr/bin/git>)._\n\n5. Open a new _RMarkdown_ script using the 'GitHub Document (Markdown)' template, save the file, and then using the _git_ integration in _RStudio_, commit the file for the first time. Go check the contents of the folder in Explorer (Windows) or Finder (OSX).\n\n6. 'knit' the file and inspect the output (it may show in the _RStudio_ viewer pane or spawn a new window depending on your _RStudio_ setup). Go check the contents of the folder in Explorer (Windows) or Finder (OSX).\n\n7. Change the title (e.g., Assignment 1) and add your name _(hint: author: name)_ to the YAML header of the file created in step 5. \n\n7. 'knit' the file and inspect the output. \n\n8. Commit the files.\n\n9. Using NotePad, create a new file ('README.md') in the 'assignment-1' folder. \n    a. Add the following text to the file:\n\n        > Assignment 1\n        >\n        > PHSL4005 Introduction to Biostatistics\n        >\n        > This repository contains files for the first assignment of the course.\n        >\n        > You can find the gitHub Pages site for the course at the following site.\n\n    b. Make the first line a H2 heading.\n\n    c. Make the second line bold.\n\n    d. Make the term 'GitHub Pages' italic and bold.\n\n    e. Make the word 'site' a hyperlink to the following URL: https://kamermanpr.github.io/PHSL4005-introductory-biostats.git\n\n    f. Add and commit the file.\n\n10. Using NotePad, create a new file (LICENSE.md)in the 'assignment-1' folder.\n    a. Add an H2 heading: 'LICENSE' to the file.\n\n    b. Go to https://creativecommons.org/choose/ and create a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license for your content. \n\n    c. Copy and paste the html code into the LICENSE.md file, and save, add, commit the file.\n\n11. Using NotePad, create a new file called '.gitignore', and add appropriate text to the file to ensure that 'html' files are not tracked by git.\n\n12. Open a new, empty repository on your gitHub account called: 'assignment-1'.\n\n13. Add the remote to your local git repository, and sync the local files with the remote.\n\n14. In 'assignment-1.Rmd':\n\n    a. Update the knitr default chunk options as follows:\n\n        - Figures must be saved to a subfolder of your 'assignment-1â€™ folder called 'figures'.\n\n        - Figure dimensions must be 8\" x 8\" and centre aligned.\n\n        - Ensure no messages are shown when parsing the file.\n\n    b. Stop the second code chunk ('cars') being displayed in the output file.\n\n    c. Have the plot in the third code chunk ('pressure') be center aligned (without changing the `knitr::optschunk$set()` code in the first chunk).\n\n15. Save, and commit the file.\n\n16. Knit the document, and open the resulting 'assignment-1.md' file in RStudio and preview as html.\n\n17. Add and commit any new files generated by the knitting prosses, and then push the local repository to the remote.\n\n18. Email the lecturer a link to your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
